    <h1>My first picture on the website</h1>
    <img src="images/lovely.jpg" alt="a picture saying lovely">
    <p>This is the first paragraph I have written on a website that I have developed
        completely on my own. I hope it looks good. I have added no breaks. In the above,
        you can see a picture stating "Lovely". Lovely is a word used to describe something
        that one likes. Alternatively, lovely can be used sarcastically to suggest one enjoys
        something when they really do not. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1Pl8CzNzCw">Lovely</a> can be replaced with the following words</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Great</li>
        <li>Fantastic</li>
        <li>FML</li>
        <li>Fudge</li>
     </ul>
    <p>Alternatively, when thinking of other words to replace lovely with, consider the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Am I being sarcastic?</li>
            <li>Do I want to sound sarcastic even though I am not?</li>
            <li>Is what is happening actually lovely?</li>
        </ol>
